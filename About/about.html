            <p>I am so happy to be your faculty advisor for the Plein Air and Figure Drawing Club. You are encouraging a life-long practice of observational drawing, which will give you the skill and tools to bring anything from your imagination into being. I have been teaching some form of drawing/painting/design at Parsons since 1983, and drawing has always been a passion of mine.</p>

            <p>Hello! I am Daisy Warren, a Creative Technologist based in San Diego, CA, and NYC. I enjoy creating experiences, joy, and delightful work. I work on websites, interactive experiences, games, concept art, and more. Plein Air Club is a way for me to continue practicing traditional arts and experimenting with different mediums. I hope to share the joy, freedom, and expression that comes from making artwork in places that are otherwise temporary in our daily lives. I also aim to push artists to remember that connection. I would love to talk more if anything aforementioned interests you!</p>

            <p>Hi! I am Audrey, and I am an illustrator from NYC. I really enjoy visual development and character design, which I often incorporate into my personal practice. In my art, I frequently explore themes of girlhood within the fantastical. Plein Air Club has been the perfect place to hone my skills outside the classroom. It has been so exciting to draw while exploring the city, do figure drawing, and build a new community.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Melissa, and I’m a Fashion Designer from NYC. I enjoy using avant-garde elements in my work to create vulnerable and emotionally charged designs. My work is rooted in complex concepts that are often inspired by personal experiences. Plein Air Club is a space where I’m able to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about their craft. All majors are welcome, which allows us to share our knowledge and perspectives with each other.</p>
