     <!-- The problem with that approach is that it produces a semantic error that is flagged as a warning by the W3C HTML Validator. The purpose of the <section> element is to divide its parent container into multiple sections. Also, <section>s should always open with a heading, with very few exceptions. The solution is to replace the <section> with the <figure> element. Then within the 'imageContainer' class style rule add the margin property set to the 0 value. Next assign the 'imageContainer' class to the <figure> element. -->

            <!-- Skipping headings is a semantic error. An <h2> must be preceded by and sub to an <h1>. When validating your HTML, make it a practice to select the outline option. Choosing this option will display a listing of your heading levels at the bottom of the Validator's Results page, where the Validator will point out if you have skipped any heading levels. One solution is to convert the <span> within the above <header> to the <h1> element. -->
